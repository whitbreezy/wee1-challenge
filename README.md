# week1-challenge

## Description

For this project, I started with some source code provided by my instructor. I copied the files into a new repository in github, cloned the repository to my local machine, and started to make changes. The goal of this project was to add semantic elements and alt tags for accessibility, and to consolidate classes using semantic tags. I learned a lot about how to consolidate styles into semantic tags so that you don't have to create a new class for each piece.
